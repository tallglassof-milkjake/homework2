First commit after playing with html and some css bootstrap styling and assessing effects of 
media queries.

Initial creation of navbar successful, main content a little less success but moving forward on understanding grid



<!--20/08/20-->

Abandoned all other code

Created a mockup UI/design using adobe XD (will include screenshots to show process)

Made a navbar for index.html

added a jumbotron with placeholder about me text and an image

made a footer for the base of the page

Sent the navbar and footer across all pages (index.html-portfolio.html-contact.html)

Connected all links to eachother across every page

Added a landing page to experiment with more in depth effects (may or may not commit with homework)

Started planning further design/color themes (nothing drastic, just something to add a personal touch)
